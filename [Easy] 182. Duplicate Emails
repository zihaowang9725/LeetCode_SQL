Skill points: 

1. Difference between HAVIING and WHERE:
    a. A WHERE clause is used is filter records from a result.  The filter occurs before any groupings are made
    b. A HAVING clause is used to filter values from a group

2. GROUP BY:
    a. To group rows that have the same values into summary rows
    b. GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns

3. Order: WHERE > GROUP BY > HAVING > ORDER BY
    
4. Temporary table: mush has its own alias otherwise there will be error
